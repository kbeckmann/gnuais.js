This is an experiment to run gnuais in javascript. The purpose is to have a fully functional AIS receiver running in a browser without the need of any additional software such as flash or a daemon running in the background.

This is currently a very crude hack!

Usage:
Install Emscripten (https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Emscripten-SDK)
Run src/build_javascript.sh
Open "ais.html" and prepare to be astonished.
